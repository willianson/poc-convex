Convex.dev is a **serverless backend platform** designed for modern web apps. 
It provides real-time data synchronization, automatic scaling, 
and a simple API for handling queries and mutations, all without the need 
to manage servers or databases. It allows developers to focus on business 
logic while Convex manages the backend infrastructure.

**React + TypeScript + Vite**
